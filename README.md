NAIS, SMPS, PSM, Air quality data analysis

So far I started with analysis of data for a very short period and only from the NAIS (16th May - 30th June). I also downloaded the met data(temp, RH, WD, WS, Rain), NO (NO2, NOx), and O3 data for complementary analysis.
https://doi.org/10.5194/ar-1-81-2023 was a great reference for NPF analysis.
